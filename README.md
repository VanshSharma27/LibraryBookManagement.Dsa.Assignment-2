# LibraryBookManagement.Dsa.Assignment-2
This Python-based Library Book Management System uses a linked list to store books (with ID, title, author, and status) and a stack for transaction tracking. It supports inserting, deleting, searching, and displaying books. Users can issue/return books, updating their status, and undo the last transaction. View recent transactions via the stack.
